#  ZMLE

**Z80 Macros, Labels and Equats** is a Z80 library for rapid development on the Z80.

*ZMLE* uses **RASM (Rapoudou Assembler)** as assembler.

#  Requirements to assemble the library

You only need to have make installed, an x86 processor in case you are using Linux or Windows.

For Mac it depends on how it was compiled in the official *RASM* releases.
